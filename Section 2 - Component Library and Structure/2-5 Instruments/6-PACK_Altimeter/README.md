Welcome to the Altimeter of your dreams!

How to navigate the files?
- Source Files is where you'll find all of the raw files if you want to make any customizations for yourself.
- Mirror Mirror contains the Right Side Knob

__Bill 'o Materials:__
ðŸ“¦ 3D Printed Parts
ðŸ“¦ Arduino Mega 2560 (can be shared with other components)
ðŸ“¦ Decal (You can use a shipping label)
ðŸ“¦ (8) M3x6mm screws 
ðŸ“¦ (4) M3x20mm countersunk screws
ðŸ“¦ (3) BYJ-48 Stepper motors and their drivers
ðŸ“¦ Bournes 10K 10 turn potentiometer
ðŸ“¦ A little bit of sanity


To swap which side your knob is on:
Mirror ALT VSI Bezel.stl
Mirror Faceplate.stl
Mirror Motor Mount.stl

You can also use the default files and mirror the files in your slicer.
