Welcome to the Circuit Breaker of your dreams!

To navigate all of the files on your journey towards homecockpitness:
- NEW refers to an electromagnet solenoid with a smaller shaft
- OLD refers to the one first shown in my V1 video with a larger shaft
- Print "Button" if you want a GA style non pullable breaker
- Use the Pullable Circuit Breakers files if you want a pullable Airliner style breaker
- Source Files is where you'll find all of the raw files if you want to make any customizations for yourself.
