Welcome to the LCD Radio of your dreams!

To navigate all of the files on your journey towards homecockpitness,
"ONE-HOLE" refers to one hole on the right side.
"TWO-HOLE" refers to two holes on the right side (giving you a "favorite" knob)
Technically there are 15 or 16 holes, but One/Two is less counting.

Source Files is where you'll find all of the raw files if you want to make any customizations for yourself.

V1 Small Multi Radio 16x2 is a folder that houses the original design that was a lot smaller.
Use this only with the 16x2 radio. Isn't it cute!
