# The-Cessna-172-Project-V3

These plans are based on a ["Pay What You Want"](https://www.paypal.com/donate?business=H4MLB9GPEUEX4&item_name=Cessna+172+Project&currency_code=USD) model. Though I could charge money for these plans, I want to give this project's plans and files away on this GitHub for free.

## Spreadsheet
	Files in this GitHub may not represent the most up to date version of the project.
	Also: Top level files are usually to big to store on GitHub.

	Please start an issue should a link not properly work.
The Spreadsheet shows the "live" versions of everything. These have not been formally released so may have bugs. Use this method if you are a risk taker :)

## Issues:
We all have issues. Let's be honest. If you find any that pertain to the 172 project, create a new blank issue, and describe what it is the best you can.
Create a new issue for if a part breaks, so we can factor it into a redesign.

## Why?
The Flight Simulation Community has given me so much and I would like to give back. Free C172 Plans were what started me off in flight simulation when I was younger, and I don't want cost to be an obstacle for any young aspiring individuals to build their very own Cessna 172 Flight Sim.

If you are just getting started in Flight Simulation: I believe in you. You can do this. It will take time and hard work, but for me it is definitely worth it, and you might find it is too.
