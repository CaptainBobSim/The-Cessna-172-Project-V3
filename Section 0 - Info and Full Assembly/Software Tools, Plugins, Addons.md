## Online Tools/Generators

Image measure given a dimension: https://eleif.net/photo_measure.html
Spur Gear Generator: *Recently I've Been Using This One* https://evolventdesign.com/pages/calculators
I prefer this instead of Fusion, because Fusion doesn't let you preview it.
Neither really lets you change it later, so I prefer this one, where I can just delete and paste the new sketch.
