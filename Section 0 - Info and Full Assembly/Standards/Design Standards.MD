## GEARS
Use Module 1.5
Find the pitch diameter of the gear and divide it by 1.5 to get the amount of teeth the gear needs.
Make sure your pitch diameter is in multiples of 2 so it can be halved!

## Arduinos: 
Each pin may not draw more than 40 mA of current!
Each Arduino MEGA may not draw more than 150mA of current! [200mA is actual limit - 150mA is safety limit]
Components male, Arduino female?
