Universal laser cutters use eight RGB colors: 00000 (black), ff0000 (red), 00ff00 (green), ffff00 (yellow), 0000ff (blue), ff00ff (magenta), 00ffff (cyan), ff6600 (orange).
The colors I assign these to is here:

| HEX    | Color    |	RGB Value                   |     Description |
| ---    | -------- |	--------------------------  |   ----------------|
| 00000	 | (black)  |	RGB: 0	 	0   	0   |	FOR CUTTING EDGES |
| ff0000 | (red)    |	RGB: 255 	0   	0   | 	FOR ETCHING TEXT |
| 00ff00 | (green)  |	RGB: 0	 	255 	0   |	FOR 2ND TEXT/AUX Stronger Etch |
| 0000ff | (blue)   |	RGB: 0	 	0   	255 |	FOR 3RD TEXT/AUX Even Stronger Etch |
| ffff00 | (yellow) | 	RGB:255	 	255 	0   |	FOR CUTTING PAPER (ie Labels) USE THIS ONE not orange :) |
| ff6600 | (orange) | 	RGB: 255 	102 	0   |	FOR CUTTING PAPER OUTLINE/PAPER AUX 2 (Cut Label Entirely) |
| ff00ff | (magenta)|	RGB: 255 	0   	255 |	FOR ALLIGNMENT - Do not set this to actually fire anything! You can set this to the size of your material and jog the head to it. |
| 00ffff | (cyan)   |	RGB: 0	 	255 	255 |	FOR ETCHING PAPER (ie to test on paper first) |
