Hello Fellow Developers!

Your work is very valuable to the flight simulation community! Thank you so much for all you do!

As a contributor/developer you have the ability to set folder level licenses, described in the (["What are these.MD"](https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3/blob/main/Section%200%20-%20Info%20and%20Full%20Assembly/FOLDER%20LEVEL%20LICENSES%20-%20for%20contributers/What%20are%20these.MD) file under ["Section 0 - Info and Full Assembly/FOLDER LEVEL LICENSES - for contributers/"]([https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3/tree/main/Section%200%20-%20Info%20and%20Full%20Assembly/FOLDER%20LEVEL%20LICENSES%20-%20for%20contributers)
Contribtors can make their work use the default license, make their work Open-Source, or make their files so that nobody (including me) can sell their work.
