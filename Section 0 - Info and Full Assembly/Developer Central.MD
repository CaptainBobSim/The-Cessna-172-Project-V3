Well Hello Fellow Developers!
Thank you so much for all you do!

### Licensing
Your work is very valuable to the flight simulation community! I want to make sure that I respect your hard work.

As a contributor/developer you have the ability to set folder level licenses, described in the (["What are these.MD"](https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3/blob/main/Section%200%20-%20Info%20and%20Full%20Assembly/FOLDER%20LEVEL%20LICENSES%20-%20for%20contributers/What%20are%20these.MD) file under ["Section 0 - Info and Full Assembly/FOLDER LEVEL LICENSES - for contributers/"](https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3/tree/main/Section%200%20-%20Info%20and%20Full%20Assembly/FOLDER%20LEVEL%20LICENSES%20-%20for%20contributers)
This lets you to choose to use the default license, make their work Open-Source, or make their files so that nobody (including me) can sell their work.

### What to work on?
Everything is managed via [Issues](https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3/issues) and the [Project](https://github.com/users/CaptainBobSim/projects/2/views/1)
You can choose anything in the "No Status" column of the Project. 

If there's something you want to work on, make an [issue for the part](https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3/issues/new), and assign it to yourself.
