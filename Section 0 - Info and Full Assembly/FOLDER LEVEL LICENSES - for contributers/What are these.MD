Why?
If I develop something I prefer to have it accessible for free but not open source.
This allows hobbyists to use it, but prevents companies from ripping off my designs and undercutting development funding through the CaptainBobSim.com/Shop store.
I am considering eventually open-sourcing everything but would like to first be in a financially stable spot.


If you make files you can take a few actions:

- No Action (no file inside folder)
If the contributor takes no action, the folder and subfolders use the default license: https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3/blob/main/LICENSE
This means that I can sell these items in my shop (CaptainBobSim.com/shop) to help fund further development.

- Add file "THIS FOLDER IS OPEN SOURCE.MD" inside folder:
If a contributor wants to make their "Open Source", then the unlicense is applied and anyone can use the files for whatever they want.

- Add file "LICENSE NON-COMMERCIAL NO SALES.MD" inside folder:
If you don't want me (or anyone else) to be able to sell it use the "DO NOT SELL"
You may sell things you develop.
If the [project level license](https://github.com/CaptainBobSim/The-Cessna-172-Project-V3/blob/main/LICENSE) is moved to an "OPEN-SOURCE" state (ie. all files are open source), then this folder and subfolders disregard the "NO SALES" constraint (anyone can sell it)
Use this license if you don't want to see items you design in the CaptainBobSim.com/shop store.


Contributors may only add files if they are the primary contributor.
If Captain Bob designs something, and a contributor you change it slightly you aren't allowed to "Open-Source" the design.
