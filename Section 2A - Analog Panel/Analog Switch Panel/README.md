UnfortunatelyJay VR took this switch down. Before he took it to me he licensed it to me for manufacturing, but not file sharing.

Unfortunately because of this licensing clash, the only way to get it is to source a real one or purchase the model from me: https://captainbobsim.com/product/master-avionics-switch/

Luckily Steve also made a switch, that you can find in "Steve Sweeney's" folder. As of writing I have not tested this.
